# Report fields without description
Github action which help you to configure reports on fields whitout description

## Purpose

1. Clarity and Communication: Descriptions provide clear and concise information about what the field is used for, which can help other users and administrators better understand the purpose of the field. This can prevent confusion and improve communication across different teams or departments within an organization.

2. Documentation and Reference: Descriptions can serve as documentation for the field, which can be helpful for future reference. When fields are added or changed, the descriptions can provide valuable context and history that can be referred to later on.

3. Training and Onboarding: Descriptions can be particularly helpful for new users or administrators who are not familiar with the Salesforce system. Having clear descriptions can help these individuals quickly understand how the field is used and what its purpose is, which can speed up their training and onboarding.

4. Compliance and Governance: Depending on the industry and regulations, there may be certain requirements for data privacy, security, and governance. Descriptions can help ensure that fields are used appropriately and in compliance with these regulations, as they provide clarity and transparency around how the field is used and what data it contains.

In summary, writing descriptions for Salesforce custom fields can improve communication, provide documentation and reference, aid in training and onboarding, and help ensure compliance and governance.
